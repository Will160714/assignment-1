        <h1>Panda</h1>
        <p>
            The panda, also known as the giant panda or panda bear, is a beloved and iconic species native to the mountainous 
            regions of central China. Known for its distinctive black-and-white fur coat, the panda is easily recognizable and 
            has captured the hearts of people around the world. Pandas are primarily herbivorous, with bamboo making up the majority 
            of their diet. They have a specialized digestive system and spend most of their time eating and resting to digest their
            food. Despite their large size, pandas are gentle and solitary animals, typically avoiding confrontation with other 
            animals. Due to habitat loss, poaching, and other threats, pandas are classified as a vulnerable species, and extensive 
            conservation efforts are underway to protect and preserve their natural habitats. Symbolizing conservation efforts and 
            environmental awareness, the panda has become an international symbol of wildlife conservation and biodiversity.
