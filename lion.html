            Lions, often referred to as the "king of the jungle," are iconic and majestic big cats known for their 
            distinctive appearance, powerful roars, and social structure. Found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa and a 
            small population in the Gir Forest of India, lions are the only truly social cats, living in groups known as 
            prides. The pride typically consists of related females, their offspring, and a coalition of one or more 
            dominant males. Known for their strength and cooperative hunting techniques, lions are apex predators capable 
            of taking down large prey such as wildebeests, zebras, and buffalo. Despite their fearsome reputation, lions 
            spend much of their time resting and conserving energy, with bursts of activity during hunting and territorial 
            defense. Lions play a crucial role in the ecosystem by controlling prey populations and shaping the structure of 
            their habitats.
