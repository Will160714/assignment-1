        <h1>Eagle</h1>
        <p>
            Eagles are majestic birds of prey known for their impressive size, powerful beaks, and keen eyesight. Belonging to 
            the family Accipitridae, eagles are found on every continent except Antarctica, with different species adapted to 
            various habitats ranging from forests and mountains to grasslands and wetlands. With wingspans that can exceed two 
            meters in some species, eagles are skilled hunters capable of catching a wide range of prey, including fish, mammals, 
            and birds. They are apex predators in their ecosystems and play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance. Eagles 
            are also revered in many cultures and symbolize strength, freedom, and power. Due to habitat loss, pollution, and other 
            human-related threats, some eagle species are facing conservation challenges, making conservation efforts essential to 
            ensure their survival for future generations to admire and appreciate their beauty and significance in nature.
